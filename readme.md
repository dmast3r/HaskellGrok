# Haskell Learning Path

This repository contains my personal notes and code snippets as I learn Haskell. Each concept is organized into its own directory, which contains a markdown file with notes and a Haskell file with relevant code examples.

Following are the resources that I have used:

1. [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)
2. [The Complete Haskell Course: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-haskell-course-from-zero-to-expert/)
3. [Haskell - Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell)

## Structure

Each directory in the repository corresponds to a specific Haskell concept. Inside each directory, you'll find:

- A `.hs` file containing Haskell code related to the concept.
- A `.md` file containing notes on the concept.

## Concepts Covered

- Lists
- Functions
- (More to be added as I continue learning)

## Usage

To run any of the Haskell code examples, navigate to the appropriate directory and use the `runghc` command followed by the `.hs` file name.

For example, to run the code for lists, use:

```bash
cd lists
runghc lists.hs
